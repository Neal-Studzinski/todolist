Create a simple ToDo list application using HTML, Sass, JavaScript and the jQuery library.

Your app should at a minimum include a text field for the user to create new ToDos, and a list of already created ToDos for the user to see, and a button for each item on the list to delete it.

When the user enters a new ToDo, it should save to tiny-pizza-server.

When the page loads, your app should GET all the todos stored on the server and display them in the list.

When the user clicks the delete button next to an item, it should delete that item from the server
